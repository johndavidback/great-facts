# AI Agent Rules for Fact Machine Project

This document outlines the guidelines for AI agents contributing to the Fact Machine project. Adherence to these rules ensures consistency, quality, and alignment with the project's core vision.

## 1. Code Quality and Verification

*   **Testing:** All new code or significant modifications must be accompanied by appropriate tests. Ensure existing tests pass and new tests adequately cover the changes.
*   **Build Success:** Before submitting any changes, verify that the project builds successfully without errors or warnings. Use the `npm run build` command to confirm.
*   **Code Execution:** All implemented features and fixes must run successfully and perform as intended in the development environment.
*   **Style Guidelines:** Adhere strictly to the existing code style, formatting, and naming conventions observed throughout the project. Utilize linting tools if available.

## 2. Front-End Development

*   **Consistency:** Any new front-end components or UI elements must seamlessly match the existing design, structure, and framework choices.
*   **User Experience (UX):** Prioritize a user experience that is **silly, fun, and engaging**. All interactions should reflect the cartoonish and wacky aesthetic of the Fact Machine webpage.
*   **Responsiveness:** Ensure all new UI elements and layouts are fully responsive and look great on both desktop and mobile devices.

## 3. General Principles

*   **Clarity:** Code should be clear, readable, and well-organized.
*   **Efficiency:** Strive for efficient solutions that do not negatively impact performance.
*   **Safety:** Avoid introducing any security vulnerabilities or exposing sensitive information.
